        The nine important measures which should be taken to reduce poverty in India are as follows: <br>1. Accelerating Economic Growth <br>2. Agricultural Growth and Poverty Alleviation <br>3. Speedy Development of Infrastructure <br>4. Accelerating Human Resource Development <br>5. Growth of Non-Farm Employment <br>6. Access to Assets <br>7. Access to Credit <br>8. Public Distribution System (PDS) <br>9. Direct Attack on Poverty: Special Employment Schemes for the Poor <br><br>
    </p>
    <h3>1. Accelerating Economic Growth:</h3><br>
    <p>In the fifties and sixties it was generally thought that poverty in India can be significantly reduced by accelerating economic growth. According to this view, benefits of economic growth will trickle down to the poor in the form of more employment opportunities, greater productivity and higher wages. With this it was expected that the poor will be raised above the poverty line. <br>
        Various growth models put forward in the fifties and sixties such as Harrod-Domar growth model, Mahalanobis growth model, Lewis’ model of economic development with unlimited supplies of labour suggested rapid growth of the modern industrial sector to tackle the problem of poverty in the long sun. For this purpose they suggested for increasing the rate of capital formation so as to generate more employment opportunities and increase productivity of labour. <br>
        Though this is correct that higher rate of capital formation is necessary for accelerating economic growth and thereby for solving the problem of poverty, but this will not generate sufficient employment opportunities if labour – saving capital-intensive techniques of production are used in the process of growth. <br>
        This has been clearly brought out by the actual experience in India in the eighties and nineties whereas in the two decades of development, rate of growth in GDP achieved is in the range of 5.5 per cent to 6 per cent per annum there has been only little increase in employment opportunities, especially in the organised industrial sector. <br>
        Therefore, while efforts should be made to accelerate economic growth but if it has to make a significant dent on the problem of poverty the use of capital-intensive technologies imported from the Western Countries should be avoided. In fact, we should pursuer labour-intensive path of economic growth. Such monetary and fiscal policies should be adopted that provide incentives for using labour-intensive techniques. <br>
    </p>
    <h3>2. Agricultural Growth and Poverty Alleviation:</h3><br>
    <p>Agricultural growth has been recognized as an important factor that contributes to marked reduction in poverty. A study made by Montek Ahuluwalia, former member of Planning Commission, brought clearly that agricultural growth and poverty are inversely related; the higher agricultural growth leads to lower poverty ratio. The expe­rience of Punjab and Haryana in the late sixties and in the seventies confirmed this inverse relation between agriculture growth and poverty. <br>
        The growth in agricultural output in these states propelled by the adoption of new-high yielding technology caused a marked reduction in poverty in these states. Rural poverty ratio in Punjab and Haryana was 6.4 and 8.3 per cent respectively in 1999-2000. <br>
        Therefore, other states have been urged to follow the path of Punjab and Haryana for reduction of rural poverty. Thus, Late Prof. S. Chakravarty states, “the solution to the problem of rural poverty requires that small farmers must also be given access to land-augmenting innovations”. By land augmenting innovations he means the new high-yielding technology represented by green revolution that occurred first in Punjab and Haryana. <br> 
        However, in the recent years relationship between agricultural growth and poverty reduction seems to have weakened. For example, at all India level, employment elasticity of growth in agricultural output has been found to be zero during 1993-94-1999-2000 whereas it was 0.45 during 1977-78-1983. <br>
        It appears that at the all India level employment generated by new green revolution technology has been cancelled out by increasing mechanisation of agricultural operations in various parts of a country. Thus, even in the light of the finding of zero employment elasticity of agricultural output at the all India level, positive impact of agricultural growth on the incomes of small farmers and, more particularly on the wage income of agricultural labourors, cannot be denied. <br>
        To ensure marked decline in rural poverty through agricultural growth, rate of agricultural growth should be accelerated by increasing public investment in irrigation and other infrastructure. In recent years since 1980, rate of capital formation in agriculture has been declining. <br>
        This trend has to be reversed by increasing public investment in agriculture, especially irrigation. Besides, higher agricultural growth can be achieved in semi-arid and rain-fed areas by increasing public investment in infrastructure and ensuring adequate access to credit to the small farmers. <br>
    </p>
    <h3>3. Speedy Development of Infrastructure:</h3><br>
    <p>An important measure to generate employment opportunities for the poor and to raise their productivity is the speedy development of infrastructure. Since private sector is not attracted to make adequate investment in infrastructure, public investment needs to be stepped up for its development. Infrastructure development consists of building of roads, highways, ports, telecommunication, power and irrigation. They involve mainly construction work which is highly labour intensive. <br>
        Besides, the availability of infrastructure such as power and irrigation greatly raise productivity of labour. C.H. Hanumantha Rao in his study of East and South East Asian Countries finds that reduction in rural poverty in them achieved through economic growth occurred due to the fact that physical infrastructure in them were already highly developed. <br>
        To quote him, “The experience of East and South East Asian Countries shows that the impact of development on rural poverty reduction has been greatest in situations where land reforms have been implemented effectively and a high priority has been accorded to infrastructure development, agriculture and human resource development within a liberalised economic policy framework. <br>
        These facts suggest, in the first place, that in a country like India where the physical and social infrastructure is inherited from the pre-liberalisation period is not strong and redistribution of land on a significant scale is not feasible, public investment needs to be stepped up for expending physical infrastructure in the less developed areas. <br>
    </p>
    <h3>4. Accelerating Human Resource Development:</h3><br>
    <p>Besides physical infrastructure development, poverty can also be reduced through human resource development. Human resource development requires greater investment in educational facilities such as schools to promote literacy, technical training institutes and vocational colleges to import skills to the people. Further, human resource development requires health care by public investment in Primary Health Centres, dispensaries and hospitals. <br>
        This human resource development not only generates a good deal of employment opportunities but also raises productivity and income of the poor. Further, people equipped with skills, education and good health can easily get wage employment or self-employment with higher productivity. <br>
        In this way human resource development helps in reducing poverty. The experience of East and South-East Asian Countries, referred to above and Kerala in our country shows that poverty can be significantly reduced through investment in human resource development. However, private sector, guided as it is by profit motive, will not adequately invest in the human resource development. <br>
    </p>
    <h3>5. Growth of Non-Farm Employment:</h3><br>
    <p>For reduction of poverty growth of non-farm employ­ment in the rural areas is of special importance. Non-farm employment is created in marketing (i.e., petty trade), transportation, handicrafts, dairying, and forestry, processing of food and other agricultural products, repair workshops. <br>
        A study of poverty alleviation in Haryana brings out that significant reduction in rural poverty in Haryana in spite of a reduction in employment opportunities in agriculture was due to the remarkable increase in non-farm employment. Similarly, a study of Andhra Pradesh also shows that poverty declined more rapidly in the districts adjoining Hyderabad city due to large increase in non-farm employment. <br>
    </p>
    <h3>6. Access to Assets:</h3><br>
    <p>
        Rapid growth of population after independence has led to greater sub- di­vision and fragmentation of agricultural holdings and lack of employment opportunities in industries and other non-farm sectors has worsened the conditions of agricultural labour and self-employed small farmers. <br>
        With no land or little land they can not engage themselves in self-employment activi­ties for earning adequate income to meet their basic needs. Redistribution of land through effective redistribution, implementation of tenancy reforms so as to ensure security of tenure and fixation of fair rent would be an important measure of reducing rural poverty. Except in case of West Bengal and Kerala land reforms have not been implemented to reduce rural poverty. <br>
        However, abolition of Zamindari system is the only land reform measure which has been faithfully implemented in several parts of the country. Other land reform measures, namely, ceilings on land holdings, protection of tenants against eviction, and regulation of fair rent by the Government have remained unimplemented except in case of West Bengal and Kerala. <br>
        But without land reform?, a significant dent on the problem of rural poverty cannot be made. On small farms labour employment per hectare, output per hectare and double cropping are greater as compared to those of large farmers. <br>
        Tenants who enjoy no security of tenure do not invest adequately in yield-increasing inputs to raise their productivity. The effective implementation of land reforms to ensure access to land and security of tenure are essential for the reduction of poverty. <br>
        But, unfortunately, the present Planning Commission and the Government do not attach much importance to these much awaited land reforms. Citing the experience of East and South East Asia in which both rate of growth and poverty reduction have been remarkable Prof. C.H. Hanumanth Rao states, “their experience shows that the impact of development on rural poverty reduction has been greatest in situation where land reforms have been implemented effectively. <br>
    </p>
    <h3>7. Access to Credit:</h3><br>
    <p>
        Availability of credit to the poor on easy terms can create the conditions for small farmers gaining access to productive resources such as HYV seeds fertilizers, construction of minor irrigation such as wells and tubewells. This will enable the small farmers to adopt high- yielding technology to raise their productivity. <br>
        The new technology is size-neutral, that is, it can be adopted equally well by small farmers. But the adoption of new technology requires financial resources which are lacking with the small farmers. Besides, the non-farmer poor need credit for marketing, food processing, dairying, forestry, development of handicrafts which can provide them gainful employment. <br>
        Important changes have been introduced in the credit delivery system in India. Expansion of network of rural branches of commercial banks after nationalisation and fixation of limits for compulsory lending to the priority sectors (which include agriculture, small-scale industries) and fixation of lower interest rates to be charged from the poor farmers and artisans some progress has been made in this regard. <br>
        However, banks and other financial institutions have not shown adequate response to provide adequate credit to them as they consider the poor to be non-creditworthy. Unless the banks and other financial institutions change their attitude toward supplying credit to the poor much success cannot be achieved to ensure adequate credit to the poor farmers and artisans. What they do need is short-term loan for working capital such as for purchasing raw materials, fertilizers, pesticides. <br> 
        An important step in credit delivery system for the poor has been setting up of regional rural banks (RRB). Regional rural banks are primarily meant to meet the credit needs of the poor. The Government should take effective steps to improve the functioning of these financial institutions so as to ensure availability of adequate credit to the poor. <br>
    </p>
    <h3>8. Public Distribution System (PDS):</h3><br>
    <p>
         
Poor households spend nearly 80 per cent of their income on food. Therefore, an effective way of raising rural incomes and ensuring food security to the poor households is an assured supply of adequate quantity of food-grains and other essential commodities at subsidised prices, that is, at prices which are lower than the market prices. <br>
A properly functioning public distribution system which is targeted to the poor households is an important element of the strategy for poverty reduction. The Central Government Organisation ‘Food Corporation of India’ procures the food-grains from the farmers at the minimum support prices (MSP) and store them in their warehouses located throughout the country. <br>
The food-grains so procured are allotted to the state governments to be sold through the public distribution systems (i.e., ration shops) at subsidised prices which are below market prices. The difference between the two prices is paid by the Central Government as subsidy. The expenditure on food subsidy has greatly increased in recent years. The ratio of release of food-grains through PDS to total food-grains is around 10 to 13 per cent. Some economists have suggested lowering of subsidies. What is needed is to ensure subsidised food-grains supply through PDS be made only to the targeted group of households living below the poverty line and not to all households. In this way the expenditure on food subsidy can be reduced significantly and only the poor will get the benefits of the subsidy. It is worth minting that Andhra Pradesh is a shining example of using PDS to help the poor under Rs. 2 per kilogram of rice supplied through ration shops. <br>
    </p>
    <h3>9. Direct Attack on Poverty: Special Employment Schemes for the Poor:</h3><br>
    <p>
        It was realised in the early seventies that it would take a very long time for economic growth to generate enough employment opportunities to provide productive employment to all the unemployed and poor in the country. Therefore, a strategy of providing employment to the poor in the short run, special schemes of employing poor on rural public works was proposed by Dandekar and Rath in their now famous work “Poverty in India”. <br>
        The special employment scheme of rural public works which was launched by the Government in 5th Five Year Plan constitutes a direct attack on poverty as it does not depend on the trickledown effect of economic growth on the poor. There are mainly two types of such special anti-poverty schemes launched by the Government from time to time. <br>
        First, there are several special schemes of providing wage employment to the poor. These include Jawahar Rozgar Yojana (JRY), now named as Jawahar Gram Stimridhi Yojana after restructuring it. It is centrally sponsored scheme implemented by Gram Panchayats to generate wage employment for the rural poor. <br>
        The approach of this scheme is to employ the poor on building durable and productive community assets such as roads, small irrigation facilities, school buildings, rural electrification. These durable productive assets after completion would create employment opportunities on sustained basis. <br>
        The second special employment scheme is IRDP (Integrated Rural Development Scheme) under which self-employment of rural people is promoted by building their capacity in such activities as dairying, poultry, handicrafts, forestry. Financial assistance to them is arranged through banks for this purpose. <br>
        Similarly, a third such special employment scheme is TRYSEM (Training of Rural Youth for Self-Employment) under which rural youth are given training and equipped with skills so that they can start some self-employment activity. Bank credit is arranged to financially support them. <br>
        With effect from April 1999, IRDP and TRYSEM schemes along with the schemes of Development of Women and Children in Rural Areas (DWCRA) and Million Wells Scheme (MWS) have been merged into a single scheme called Swaran Jayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY) which aim at promoting micro-enterprises by helping the poor to form self-help groups with the assistance from the centre and states. <br>
        If implemented in a right spirit, these schemes can make useful contribution to poverty reduction in the rural areas. However, the actual performance of these schemes has not been satisfactory. While a large amount of money is spent by the Government on payment of wages, durable productive assets to be used for future use are not generally created. <br>
        Similarly, schemes for self-employment such as IRDP, TRYSEM are merely used to get loans from the banks and financial assistance from the states. They are not generally used for investment for viable schemes of productive self employment. This highlights the need for making reforms in these schemes so that they lead to the expansion of productive types of wage-employment and self-employment. <br>
